# teaching-materials
A mega-repository with several Xcode Projects designed to teach various aspects of iOS Development.

Please put any educational content you create into this repo to help future officers out! If you feel like your content doesn't fall under a specific folder category, add a new one (and update the README).

## Repo Structure

* **`01-Swift-Basics/`** Resources covering Swift basics (syntax, type annotations, optionals, etc...)
* **`02-SwiftUI/`** Lessons on building UIs (Standard views, custom modifiers, VStack/HStack/ZStack, etc...).
* **`03-Programming-Practices/`** Guides on how to write quality code. Includes lessons on design patterns like MVVM.
* **`04-Backend-and-Storage/`** Resources related to storage and networking (REST APIs, SwiftData, Core Data, Firebase, etc...)
* **`05-Specific-Topics/`** Niche topics and framework-specific tutorials, such as working with maps (MapKit), camera/audio (AVFoundation), augmented reality (ARKit), etc...

## Contribution Requirements

When adding new content to the repo please do the following:

1. Create a new subfolder in the appropriate folder. Make the name of the subfolder describe the lesson type. Add all your content inside this folder. If your topic bridges multiple concepts, place it in the folder representing the primary focus of the lesson.
2. **Include a README** in your specific lesson folder providing an overview of the content and how the lesson was intended to be taught.
